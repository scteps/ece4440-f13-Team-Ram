====================
Contains C-code, verilog, and Altera Qsys files for building a Solar Car Display on the Altera MTL (Multi-touch display) with the DE2 board. (The one that comes as a demo with the Altera system CD does not compile out of the box...) Works with Quartus 13.1 and corresponding NIOS eclipse software build tools.
